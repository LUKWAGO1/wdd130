        <P>Hello! My name is Paul Lukwago. I am a begginner of coding from Mukono, Uganda. I'm driven when it comes to technology and education; I also greatly enjoy assisting people with their tech-related queries. Looking forward to meet new like minds and learning to code as well as other cool stuff. 
            About me a little more: I love to experience and play with new technologies, and apply them in real world,escaping from mundane routine of job. I spend it mostly reading about new tech and playing around with coding projects. I also want to learn how to become a better communicator, and to share my knowledge with others.One of such goals for me on the other hand would be to learn grammar and syntax of many prgramming languages and contribute back to open-source. I think that growth as you evolve through personal and professional life is so important, always be learning and collaborating. **
            I can't wait to meet new people, share emotional</P>
